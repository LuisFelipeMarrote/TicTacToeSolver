# TicTacToeSolver

This is an application made with Python to play a game of TicTacToe against the computer, the program always make the best move possible. 

It uses concepts as Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning to respectively assure a complete and fast answer. 

The base of the code were already given since this is a project in the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python by edX. 

You can find the repository to which I started here: https://github.com/arkaprava/tictactoe/tree/ai50/projects/2020/x/tictactoe.

Although, the implametation of the fuctions to calculate the move was all made by me.
